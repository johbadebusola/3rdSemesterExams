I Created a new vue js application using the cli then simulated authentication experience using firebase and vue router. I also used VueX for state management.  I made  sure wildcard routes a.k.a 404 pages was implemented . Also, the  authentication experience  consist of the login route - ‘/login’,  the sign up route  - ‘/signup’ and the products route - ‘/products’. Users are not  able to access the products route until they’re logged in and they cant access the login route if they’re already logged in. In this exercise I also Implemented authguards. I extracted out a composable to get the currently logged-in user and created a page that shows the product’s details by using this api https://dummyjson.com/products/1. You can use this api - ‘https://dummyjson.com/products’
